## 1. About the Repository

<br />

This repository contains the **hands-on exercises developed during the Java Full Stack Bootcamp** by [Generation Brazil](https://brazil.generation.org/).

It covers topics ranging from Java fundamentals to concepts such as conditional structures, loops, arrays, collections, and methods.  
The examples are based on *Live Codes* and exercises with real-world scenarios to reinforce the content through practice.

## 3. Requirements

To run the code locally, you will need:

- [Java JDK 21+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21)
- [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/) or [Spring Tool Suite (STS)](https://spring.io/tools)

<br />

## 4. How to Run Projects in Eclipse/STS

<br />

### 4.1. Importing Projects

1. Clone the repository [generation-java-bootcamp](https://github.com/alanbrunoscience/generation-java-bootcamp) inside your Eclipse/STS *Workspace* folder:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:alanbrunoscience/generation-java-bootcamp.git
```

2. **Open Eclipse/STS** and select the *Workspace* folder where you cloned the repository.  
3. In the top menu of Eclipse/STS, click: **File ðŸ¡² Import...**  
4. In the **Import** window, select: **General ðŸ¡² Existing Projects into Workspace** and click **Next**.  
5. In the **Import Projects** window, under **Select root directory**, click **Browse...** and select the Workspace folder where you cloned the repository.  
6. Eclipse/STS will automatically recognize all the projects.  
7. Check all the projects you want to import under **Projects** and click **Finish** to complete the import.  

<br />

### 4.2. Running a Java Project
