	 * The 'Period' and 'Duration' Classes
	 * 
	 * → The 'Period' class represents a quantity of time in terms of years, months,
	 * and days. The 'Period' class is widely used to modify the values of a
	 * specific date or to get the difference between two dates.
	 * 
	 * → The 'Duration' class represents a quantity of time in terms of seconds and
	 * nanoseconds (or milliseconds, depending on the context). The 'Duration' class
	 * is widely used to modify the values of a specific time or to get the
	 * difference between two times.

	 * ⚠️ Important
	 * 
	 * → Pay Attention to Detail when working with the 'Period' and 'Duration'
	 * Classes. The 'Period' and 'Duration' Classes do not accept 'LocalDateTime'
	 * Class Objects.
